## Building ##


InveSTICKgator uses [Premake5](https://premake.github.io/download.html) generated Makefiles and IDE project files.  The generated project files are checked in under `build/` so you don't have to download and use Premake in most cases.

### Linux ###

    apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev x11proto-core-dev libx11-dev libglu1-mesa-dev
